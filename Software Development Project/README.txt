This project was part of the Software Development course in Tampere university. The project was done in groups of four people. THIS PROGRAM ISN'T FULLY MADE BY ME. I was mainly responsible about backend. Next files were my responsibility:
fingrid.hh
fingrid.cpp
model.hh
model.cpp
I also contributed a lot in the following files:
view.hh
view.cpp

The idea of this application is to provide information about weather and power consumption/production in Finland. Application fetches data from Fingrid and FMI APIs.
To function properly, personal Fingrid API key is required.
