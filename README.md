# School-Projects

This repository is to show some of the projects done in Tampere university courses and to prove that I have actually done some programming in real life. This repository does NOT contain all the projects of all the courses but mainly projects done independently. This way it's easier to show my own contribution and not to accidentally claim my teammates' code as my own.
This repo includes following projects:
- Hangman, autumn 2019
- Tetris, spring 2020
- Nysse, autumn 2020
- Software Developing course project, spring 2021
- Mobile Programming course project spring 2022
