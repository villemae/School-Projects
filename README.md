# School-Projects

This repository is meant to give an overview about projects developed during university courses. It does not include all the projects, but mainly independent ones where it's easier to show my own code and not my group members'. Exceptions to this are projects "Software Developing course project" and "EasyCharts", which were done in groups and thus not fully developed by me alone. In these cases I try to point out what is my contribution and what isn't. These group projects are included in this repo because I find them interesting and I think you might find them interesting, too.

This repository includes following projects:

- Hangman, autumn 2019
- Tetris, spring 2020
- Nysse, autumn 2020
- Software Developing course project, spring 2021
- Mobile Programming course project, spring 2022
- EasyCharts project report ( for the code, see: https://github.com/dorianpercic/EasyCharts ), spring 2023
